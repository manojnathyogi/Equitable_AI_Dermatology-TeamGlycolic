## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?

## **🚀 Next Steps & Future Improvements**

**Address the following:**

* What are some of the limitations of your model?<br />
  We had some difficulties with the model overfitting the data and inconsistencies with our results after running the model several times
* What would you do differently with more time/resources? <br />
  With more time and resources we could have researched better the reason behind the inconsistencies of our results and work around those
* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore? <br />
  We would explore different techniques related to ensemble models and other image-oriented EDA
